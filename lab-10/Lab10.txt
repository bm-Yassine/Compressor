Pointers
1 Dynamic pointers in C++
	- new and delete operator !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (memory leaks)	
	- arrays (operator new type[] and delete []array). Rapid modification of point 1
	
	- construct a regular binary tree of given depth storing random values.
	  Each node must have the fallowing structure
	  struct node
		{
			int node_id = 0;
			char node_data[11] = {0};
			node *p_left_node = nullptr;
			node *p_right_node = nullptr;
		};
	- recursive tree creation, 
	- recursive content printing,
	- random subtree extraction 
	- subtree content printing
	- subtree destroying
	- the rest of the tree destroying.
	- destroyed node should inform the usere that it is just destroyed.
2. Implementation of 3 with smart pointers (optional)

Maps
	A text file (e.g. Ulysses by Joyce - included).
1. Counting the frequency of word pairs in the file.
2. Generating a text in (pseudo)English randomly based on frequency of word pairs (from task 1).
3. Generating index (list of unique words with line numbers in which they occur) (from task 1).
