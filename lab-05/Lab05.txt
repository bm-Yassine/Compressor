Functions - New Tasks
- Function to check if a number is prime.
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (to leave only prime numbers in the range 1..N)
- Function to determine the greatest common divider.
- Function to find an integer power of a real number (take care to be 
correct for a negative power).
- A function that determines a given Fibonacci number (iteratively and 
recursively).


Function - Reworking the old tasks
- The function which fills an array with pseudorandom numbers 
(the code can be copied from lab. 4)
- The function that prints the array to the screen 
(the code can be copied from lab. 4).
- The function which sorts an array (code taken from lab. 4).
- A function that solves a system of two linear equations 
(code can be copied from lab. 2); 
	the function returns whether a solution exists, 
	and the values of x 1 and x 2 are passed by reference.
- The function that solves a linear equation 
(code can be copied from lab. 2).
- A function solving a quadratic equation 
(passing two results through function call parameters) 
(code can be copied from lab. 2).

Vector as an array of non-constant size: vector<T>.
- Function filling an array with random values (vector<T>).
- Function writing an array to the screen (vector<T>, 
for (auto a : container)cout << d;).
- Function to determine the minimum of an array (vector<T>).
- Function to sort the array (vector<T>).
