1.	Write a program that asks for two integers x, y. 
	The program should indicate which number is the largest and which is the smallest. 
	Give the arithmetic mean, geometric mean and Euclidean norm assuming that these 2 
	values are coordinates in 2D space. Note that although the input data are integers, 
	some of the parameters require floating point arithmetic.
	Hints:
		a)	the arithmetic mean is (x+y)/2;
		b)	the geometric mean is the square root of x*y (std::sqrt function in the cmath library);
		c)	the Euclidean norm is the square root of x*x+y*y.
		
2.	Write a program to solve the linear equation a*x+b=0. The program should ask for the 
	coefficients a and b. x= -b/a. Note that the user can specify the coefficient a=0. Then 
	depending on whether b=0 the number of solutions is 0 or any real number.
	
3.	Write a program to solve the square equation a*x^2+b*x+c=0 considering complex solutions. 
	Delta= b^2-4*a*c. 
	If Delta=0 then only one solution x=-b/2/a. 
	If Delta>0, then two real solutions 
		x_1=(-b - sqrt(Delta))/2/a 
	and 
		x_2=(-b + sqrt(Delta))/2/a. 
	If Delta<0 then 2 complex solutions 
		x_1=-b/2/a-sqrt(-Delta)/2/a*i
	and 
		x_2=-b/2/a+sqrt(-Delta)/2/a*i.
	"i" is a special symbol to represent the square root of -1.
