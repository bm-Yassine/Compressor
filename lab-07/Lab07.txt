Rewrite the following programs into a multi-module version. 
Each program should of course have a main.cpp file, 
plus structures.h, functions.h and functions.cpp.

Structures
- point in two-dimensional space
    - function generating a random point
    - function to fill an array with random points
    - function to find the triangle with the largest area of all possible triangles
- vectors
    - addition, subtraction of two-dimensional vectors
    - scaling a two-dimensional vector
    - dot product of vectors
    - cross product of vectors
    - function to find the distance between two points
    - function to generate a set of two-dimensional points and save it to file
    - function to find the pair of furthest points in a file
- complex numbers
    - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, multiplication
    - calculation of angles and modulus
- time - structure representing hours, minutes and seconds of time
    - adding, subtracting times
    - adding, subtracting a time vector
